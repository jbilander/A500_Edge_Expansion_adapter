# A500_Edge_Expansion_adapter
A500 86pin edge connector adapter. Turns the expansion edge into a 86pin female socket inside the A500 case.

Caveat

In order to install the adaptor you will need to remove the motherboard from the A500 case temporarily, install and put mobo back with the adaptor on. There is not enough room/clearance to install through the sidecar port opening of the A500 case.
